In 2018, she moved to Atlanta and began volunteering with Open Hands, where she served meals to residents in need. In 2020, she returned to Ohio and began volunteering with Celebrating One. With this organization, she helped children get school supplies, helped families get through emergencies, and comforted youth dealing with various issues by writing cards of encouragement.
